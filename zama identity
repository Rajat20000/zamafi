Identity and Governance
Composable onchain identity. Offchain, we use our identities all the time, from buying products online to booking plane tickets. Doing so onchain however would leak sensitive information such as your name, address, social security number and more. With FHE however, you can have a complete Decentralized ID (DID) + Verifiable Credentials (VC) system onchain, where your identity is encrypted while being fully composable with decentralized applications. Just like you can have account abstraction, you can now have identity abstraction. This is also essential for compliance in onchain payments and tokenization, as it can be used by smart contracts to verify claims in a decentralized, private manner.

Confidential governance. The idea of onchain voting, whether for DAOs, companies or governments, has been explored for as long as blockchains exist. But having the votes cast publicly onchain can lead to biases, blackmailing, or bribing. With FHE, votes (and numbers of tokens staked) can be kept private, ensuring only the final tally is revealed, and not the individual votes.
