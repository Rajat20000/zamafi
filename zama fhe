While FHE is the core technology used in the Zama Protocol, we also leverage Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) to address the shortcomings of other confidentiality solutions:

FHE enables confidentiality while being fully publicly verifiable (anyone can recompute the FHE operations and verify them). Using GPUs will soon allow scaling to 100+ transactions/s while dedicated hardware accelerators (FPGAs and ASICs) will enable scaling to thousands of transactions per second.

MPC enables decentralizing the global network key, ensuring no single party can access it. Using MPC only to generate keys and decrypt data for users minimizes latency and communication, thereby making it far more scalable and decentralized than using it for private computation.

ZK ensures the encrypted inputs provided by users were actually encrypted correctly. Using ZK only for this specific purpose makes the ZK proofs lightweight and cheap to generate in a browser or mobile app.
