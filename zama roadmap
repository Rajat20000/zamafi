Roadmap
The Zama Protocol leverages years of research and development work done at Zama. The testnet is already live, and the mainnet is planned for 2025, with a TGE at the end of the year. The timeline is as follows:

Public Testnet (already live). This will allow anyone to deploy and test their confidential dapps, as well as enabling operators to coordinate and get used to the operations.

Ethereum Mainnet (Q4 2025). This will be the first official mainnet bringing confidentiality to Ethereum. Only apps that have been approved by Zama will be available at first.

TGE + other EVM chains (End of Year). Towards the end of the year, we will launch the $ZAMA token and add more EVM chains to the Zama protocol. Anyone will be able to deploy dapps, permissionlessly.

Solana support (2026). After an initial phase of EVM-only support, we will deploy the Zama Protocol on Solana, enabling confidential SVM applications.
