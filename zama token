Tokens
Sealed-bid auctions. Sell assets such as NFTs or tokens in an onchain sealed-bid auction. Each participant places an encrypted bid onchain. When the auction ends, the highest bidder(s) win the item(s), without revealing any of the bids. Not only does this enable better price discovery, it also prevents bots from stealing the auction by monitoring the mempool. This is a particularly effective method for public token sales.

Confidential distributions. Distributing tokens currently requires disclosing publicly how much each address receives. Whether itâ€™s for airdrops, grants, investors or developers, keeping the distributed amounts private is paramount to privacy and security onchain. With FHE, protocols can distribute their token confidentially, run vesting on those encrypted tokens, enable confidential staking and more.
