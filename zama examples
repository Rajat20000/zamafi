Other examples
Onchain corporations. Managing a company onchain would be impossible without the promise of confidentiality. Indeed, information such as the cap table, financials, board votes, customers, and employee registers should not be disclosed publicly. With FHE, all this information could be kept onchain, allowing smart contracts to automate many day-to-day company operations. ‍‍

Prediction markets. ‍‍Prediction markets are based on the wisdom of the crowd concept: the average prediction of a large number of people tend to be close to the correct outcome. However, this only works if participants are not biased by previous predictions. The Zama Protocol solves this by enabling prediction markets where predictions are encrypted until revealed periodically, leading to better precision in outcomes.

Data marketplaces for AI. ‍‍AI strives on data. With FHE, users can selectively share and sell their data with companies wishing to train AI models. More than this, models can potentially be trained encrypted, with only the result being decrypted, ensuring that users have a constant stream of revenue for their data vs selling it only once and it being used forever.

These are just some examples of what can be done today. We believe that FHE, through Zama’s Protocol, will enable unprecedented liquidity, enabling users and companies to move onchain. With time and scale, it would even become possible to run entire companies, cities or even countries onchain, including their financial and identity infrastructure, elections, currency, taxes, land, car and company registries. Confidential blockchains don’t just enable programmable money: they enable programmable public infrastructure.
