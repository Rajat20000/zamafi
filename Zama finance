Confidential payments. Stablecoins are one the most successful use case for blockchain, with trillions in yearly volume. Everything from credit card payments to salaries, remittances and banking rails is now moving onchain. One of the absolute key requirement however is confidentiality and compliance. Thanks to FHE and the Zama Protocol, this is now possible: balances and transfer amounts are kept encrypted end-to-end, while payment providers can embed compliance features into the token contract directly.

Tokenization & RWAs. The tokenization of financial assets is one of the main adoption drivers of blockchain for large institutions. From fund shares to stocks, bonds or derivatives, there is up to $100T of assets that could potentially move onchain. Due to confidentiality and compliance issues however, TradFi institutions have had to rely on private blockchains, making it difficult to ensure interoperability between institutions. With the Zama Protocol, they can now use existing public blockchain such as Ethereum or Solana to tokenize and trade their assets, while keeping their activity and investor identity confidential. They can also ensure KYC/AML checks are done in the smart contracts directly, without revealing sensitive information to others. You can read more about this use case in the report published by JP Morgan - Kynexis, in which they built a proof-of-concept using Zama’s technology.

Confidential DeFi. DeFi has redefined finance by allowing anyone to participate and earn yield, but it suffers from two major issues: people don’t like sharing how much they own, and bots front-running transactions makes it expensive for end users to swap assets onchain. FHE can solve both issues by enabling end-to-end encrypted swaps, where the amount and possibly asset is kept private at all times. Some other use cases includes confidential lending, onchain credit scoring, option pricing and more.
